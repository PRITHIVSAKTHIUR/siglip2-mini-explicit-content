# **siglip2-mini-explicit-content**

> **siglip2-mini-explicit-content** is an image classification vision-language encoder model fine-tuned from **`siglip2-base-patch16-512`** for a single-label classification task. It is designed to classify images into categories related to explicit, sensual, or safe-for-work content using the **SiglipForImageClassification** architecture.

> \[!Note]
> This model is intended to promote positive, safe, and respectful digital environments. Misuse is strongly discouraged and may violate platform or regional guidelines. As a classification model, it does not generate unsafe content and is suitable for moderation purposes.

> [!Important]
Note: Explicit, sensual, and pornographic content may appear in the results; however, all of them are considered not safe for work.

The model categorizes images into five classes:

* **Class 0:** Anime Picture
* **Class 1:** Extincing & Sensual
* **Class 2:** Hentai
* **Class 3:** Pornography
* **Class 4:** Safe for Work

# **Run with Transformers**

```python
!pip install -q transformers torch pillow gradio
```

```python
import gradio as gr
from transformers import AutoImageProcessor, SiglipForImageClassification
from transformers.image_utils import load_image
from PIL import Image
import torch

# Load model and processor
model_name = "prithivMLmods/siglip2-mini-explicit-content"
model = SiglipForImageClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)
processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Updated labels
labels = {
    "0": "Anime Picture",
    "1": "Extincing & Sensual",
    "2": "Hentai",
    "3": "Pornography",
    "4": "Safe for Work"
}

def detect_explicit_content(image):
    """Predicts content category in an uploaded image."""
    image = Image.fromarray(image).convert("RGB")
    inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")

    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(**inputs)
        logits = outputs.logits
        probs = torch.nn.functional.softmax(logits, dim=1).squeeze().tolist()

    predictions = {labels[str(i)]: round(probs[i], 3) for i in range(len(probs))}
    return predictions

# Gradio Interface
iface = gr.Interface(
    fn=detect_explicit_content,
    inputs=gr.Image(type="numpy"),
    outputs=gr.Label(label="Prediction Scores"),
    title="siglip2-mini-explicit-content",

# **Guidelines for Use of siglip2-mini-explicit-content**

This model is designed for responsible content moderation and filtering. It is especially tuned for anime, hentai, and adult content. Use it ethically, with the following guidelines:

### **Recommended Use Cases**

* Content Moderation in social media and forums
* Parental Controls for safer browsing environments
* Dataset Curation for removing NSFW images from training data
* Safe Search Filtering for engines and discovery systems
* Workplace Image Scanning for compliance

### **Prohibited or Discouraged Use**

* Harassment, exposure, or targeting of individuals
* Use on private content without consent
* Illegal or unethical surveillance
* Sole reliance for legal or reputational decisions
* Deceptive manipulation of moderation results

---

# **Important Notes**

* Optimized for **anime and adult content detection**. Not suitable for detecting violence, drugs, or hate symbols.
* Probabilistic outputs â€” always **verify** with human review where needed.
* This model's predictions are **not legal classifications**.
